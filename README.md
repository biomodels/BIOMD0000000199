This is a model of neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase expressed in Escherichia
coli based on [Santolini J. et al. J Biol Chem. (2001) 276(2):1233-43](http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&li
st_uids=11038356) .  
Differing from the article, oxygen explicitly included in the reaction 2, 5
and 10 (numbers as in scheme 1 in the article). In the article the assumed
oxygen concentration of 140 uM was included in the pseudo first order rate
constant.  
Fig 2E in the article shows different time courses for citrulline and NO than
the ones produced by this model. Dr. Santolini, one of the authors of the
article, wrote that the legends in fig. 2E might be mixed up and should rather
denote NO and NO3 instead of citrulline and NO.
